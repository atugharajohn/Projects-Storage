# EMPLOYEE ATTRITION ANALYSIS AND MODEL BUILDING

## Context
The key to success in any organization is attracting and retaining top talent. 

## Task
The main task of this project is to analyse the factors that leads to employee attrition in the company, develop a model to predict a staff resigning and explore important questions such as ‘show a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition using visual representation.

## Content
The  data contained in the attached csv file is about past and current employees in the company. It has various data points on employees.

##Models
To build two tree based models using:

1. Random Forest
2. Gradient Boosting Classifier

Compare their performances when built with a balanced data and imbalanced data. The project equally shows some data preprocessing steps before model building and feature selection of the best predictors of both models.

(Hint:  Attrition  = Employees that resigned)
